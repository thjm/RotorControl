README file for Projekte/RotorControl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the README file for the rotator controller project.

Directories:
-------------

- Bootloader : contains the boot loeader for the antenna sensor uC

- Docu : various documentation files

- DisplayUR : parts takes from Ulrich Radig's (http://www.ulrichradig.de)
          PowerSupply project. The display unit presented there seems to be
          quite usable for a simple display here, just software needs to be 
          adopted.

- Eagle : contains drawings and schemes done with the Eagle layout program

- Linux : various test programs, to be run on Linux

- LSM303 : library and example for the Pololu LSM303DLH 6-axis sensor
          breakout board. The boards contains a 3-axis magnetometer and a
          3-axis accelerometer.

- Test : directory containing various test programs for the 'rotorcontrol'
         hardware environment

Project layout (Rev. 1.1)
-------------------------

- the display of UR's PS1 project will be used to display the current and the
  set value for the azimuth (directory DisplayUR)

- a LSM303DLH accelerometer and compass module will be used to determine the
  antenna direction. It will be coupled to the main electronics via a serial
  interface (coupled via RS-485)

- the main electronics module has the task to
  - receive direction information from the LSM303DLH
  - calculate/average the direction information and send it to the display 
    module
  - compare the current direction with the preset value and pass this
    information to the rotator controller (software module)
  - switch the rotator motor in an appropriate way to achieve the desired
    direction; handle (optional) end-switches and a clutch/brake
  - get users input via push buttons (attached to the main electronics or to
    the display module?)
  - ...
