README file for Projekte/RotorControl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the README file for the rotator controller project.

Directories:
-------------
- Eagle : contains drawings and schemes done with the Eagle layout program

- DisplayUR : parts takes from Ulrich Radigs (http://www.ulrichradig.de)
          PowerSupply project. The display unit presented there seems to be
          quite usable for a simple display here, just software needs to be 
          adopted.
