CHANGES file for Projekte/RotorControl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToDo next:
----------
- extend I2C driven display with more possibilities
- start with main program code
  - display heading
- when heading is updated, preset value must be updated, too

2012-05-24 (thjm) - added datasheet for MAX485 & Co.

2012-05-20 (thjm) - copyright stuff added (GNU GPL v3)
                  - code moved to compass.c, untested

2012-05-** (thjm) - PowerSupply: schematic continued, proposal for board layout
                  - i2cdisplay.h & i2cdisplay.c: I2C display routines
		  - start message "DC2IP"
		    -> this message doesn't always appear at start !?
		  - some work already on preset counter
		  - nested state machine, for CW, CCW and STOP command
		  - state machine for preset commands implemented
		  - auto power-off for preset display
		  - function (algorithm) to determine rotation direction
		  - started with some configuration variables in EEPROM

2012-05-14 (thjm) - simple rotator interaction moved to rotorstate.c
                  - get8key4.c recovered, was deleted in LSM303 directory

2012-05-13 (thjm) - cabling of RelayBoard1 partly changed
                  - some pin-swaps to ButtonBoard
		  -> blrtest.c finally works as expected

2012-05-12 (thjm) - RS485_PORT defined separately
                  - CNT0_PRESET recalculated for 12 MHz
		  - swapped LED_L and LED_R in schematic and global.h
		  - solder bridge between two buttons found and fixed
		  - rotorstate.c
		  - Test/uarttest.c, this is for USART0 (the only one on ATmega32)

2012-05-11 (thjm) - directory for test programs: Test
                    - displaytest.c etc. moved here
		  - blrtest.c: test program for buttons, LEDs and relays
		  - additional defines RELAY1 .. 4 introduced
		  - started with AntennaBoard (need drawing for LSM303DLH)

2012-05-10 (thjm) - CPUBoard: fix connections to display, somehow mirrored
                  - wiring from/to MAX232 changed slightly
		  - displaytest.c (from DisplayUR/twitest.c)
		  - after another fix to TWI pins -> displaytest.c runs!!!
		  - swapped connections to relay board1

2012-05-09 (thjm) - ATmega32 put finally on board
                    -> fuse programming (see rotorcontrol.c)
		    -> test with avrledtest (OK)

2012-05-08 (thjm) - CPUBoard:
                    - another pin-header added for RS-485 UART
		    - correct termination for RS-485 A/B lines
		  - PowerSupply: terminals added
		  - eagle_clean.sh: remove backup files of Eagle

2012-05-07 (thjm) - corrections for RelayBoard1:
                    - using right connectors from library con-molex
		    - single sided routing
		  - corrections for ButtonBoard:
		    - using right connector from library con-molex
		    - using right switches from library switch-misc (SRK/SRKL)
		  - component placement & board layout for ButtonBoard done
		  - CPUBoard:
		    - some components moved around the board
		    - re-routing (partially)

2012-05-06 (thjm) - corrections for CPUBoard:
                    - RS-485 need termination resistors etc.
		    - connectors are wrong, use 22-?-05 tec. from con-molex
		  -> connectors on other boards must be replaced, too!

2012-05-04 (thjm) - CPUBoard with some corrections, board routed (demo)
