CHANGES file for Projekte/RotorControl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToDo next:
----------
- extend I2C driven display with more possibilities
- use watchdog to reset in case of hang up
  -> then only partly initialisation
- read constants initially from EEPROM


Version xxxx: (not yet tagged)
-------------

2014-03-22 (thjm) - Bootloader directory added

2013-04-06 (thjm) - AntennaBoard: ERC errors fixed, worked on board and DRC

2012-06-06 (thjm) - actions for 'preset' functionality disabled
                    + catch position always moving

2012-06-05 (thjm) - messages to UART sometimes corrupt, fixed
                    -> UART_TX_BUFFER_SIZE, UART_RX_BUFFER_SIZE in Makefile
		       + different sizes (RX buffer large)
		  - read constants from EEPROM failed with int16_t -> float OK

2012-06-03 (thjm) - heading calculation now included
                    + linking with scanf-library for floating point !?
		    + or using atoi() based string parsing (saves 2.5k)
		    + vector.c and num2uart.c included into Makefile
		  - heading written to display
		  - average heading is also calculated, number of samples
		    can be configured easily...
		  - Makefile: target 'eeprom' added

		    -> this message doesn't always appear at start !?
		  - some work already on preset counter
		  - nested state machine, for CW, CCW and STOP command
		  - state machine for preset commands implemented
		  - auto power-off for preset display
		  - function (algorithm) to determine rotation direction
		  - started with some configuration variables in EEPROM

                  - get8key4.c recovered, was deleted in LSM303 directory

2012-05-13 (thjm) - cabling of RelayBoard1 partly changed
                  - some pin-swaps to ButtonBoard
		  -> blrtest.c finally works as expected

                  - CNT0_PRESET recalculated for 12 MHz
		  - swapped LED_L and LED_R in schematic and global.h
		  - solder bridge between two buttons found and fixed
		  - rotorstate.c
		  - Test/uarttest.c, this is for USART0 (the only one on ATmega32)

2012-05-11 (thjm) - directory for test programs: Test
                    - displaytest.c etc. moved here
		  - blrtest.c: test program for buttons, LEDs and relays
		  - additional defines RELAY1 .. 4 introduced
		  - started with AntennaBoard (need drawing for LSM303DLH)

2012-05-10 (thjm) - CPUBoard: fix connections to display, somehow mirrored
                  - wiring from/to MAX232 changed slightly
		  - displaytest.c (from DisplayUR/twitest.c)
		  - after another fix to TWI pins -> displaytest.c runs!!!
		  - swapped connections to relay board1

2012-05-09 (thjm) - ATmega32 put finally on board
                    -> fuse programming (see rotorcontrol.c)
		    -> test with avrledtest (OK)

2012-05-08 (thjm) - CPUBoard:
                    - another pin-header added for RS-485 UART
		    - correct termination for RS-485 A/B lines

		  - eagle_clean.sh: remove backup files of Eagle

2012-05-07 (thjm) - corrections for RelayBoard1:
                    - using right connectors from library con-molex
		    - single sided routing
		  - corrections for ButtonBoard:
		    - using right connector from library con-molex
		    - using right switches from library switch-misc (SRK/SRKL)
		  - component placement & board layout for ButtonBoard done
		  - CPUBoard:
		    - some components moved around the board
		    - re-routing (partially)

2012-05-06 (thjm) - corrections for CPUBoard:
                    - RS-485 need termination resistors etc.
		    - connectors are wrong, use 22-?-05 tec. from con-molex
		  -> connectors on other boards must be replaced, too!
