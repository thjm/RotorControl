CHANGES file for Projekte/RotorControl
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

ToDo next:
----------
- extend I2C driven display with more possibilities
- start with main program code
  - rotator left/right via key-press
  - display position

2012-05-10 (thjm) - CPUBoard: fix connections to display, somehow mirrored

2012-05-09 (thjm) - ATmega32 put finally on board
                    -> fuse programming (see rotorcontrol.c)
		    -> test with avrledtest (OK)

2012-05-08 (thjm) - CPUBoard:
                    - another pin-header added for RS-485 UART
		    - correct termination for RS-485 A/B lines
		  - PowerSupply: terminals added
		  - eagle_clean.sh: remove backup files of Eagle

2012-05-07 (thjm) - corrections for RelayBoard1:
                    - using right connectors from library con-molex
		    - single sided routing
		  - corrections for ButtonBoard:
		    - using right connector from library con-molex
		    - using right switches from library switch-misc (SRK/SRKL)
		  - component placement & board layout for ButtonBoard done
		  - CPUBoard:
		    - some components moved around the board
		    - re-routing (partially)

2012-05-06 (thjm) - corrections for CPUBoard:
                    - RS-485 need termination resistors etc.
		    - connectors are wrong, use 22-?-05 tec. from con-molex
		  -> connectors on other boards must be replaced, too!

2012-05-04 (thjm) - CPUBoard with some corrections, board routed (demo)

2012-04-27 (thjm) - RelayMountingPlate.jpg, tnx Ira
                  - RelayNaming.odp, includes also wiring scheme

2012-04-19 (thjm) - CPUBoard: jumper block for serial interface, MAX232 | USB

2012-04-18 (thjm) - changed global.h according to recent CPUboard schematic
                  - initialisation code for LEDs and BUTTONs added

2012-04-17 (thjm) - schematic for CPUBoard mostly complete

2012-04-11 (thjm) - ATmega-40pin.txt: overview of different pinouts

2012-04-04 (thjm) - schematic (incomplete) for power supply added

2012-03-30 (thjm) - schematic for relay board renamed
                  - second relay board added
		  - button board added
		  - main board (CPU) started

2012-01-26 (thjm) - circuit for relay board added
                  - pin definitions changed for nicer circuit drawing

2012-01-25 (thjm) - definition for rotor power relay

2012-01-03 (thjm) - Atmega32 will work with 12 MHz crystal

2011-12-29 (thjm) - button control for LEFT/RIGHT added
                  - timer controlled button query integrated
		    -> not yet tested !
		    
2011-12-27 (thjm) - first working version for I2C based display
                    -> i2cdisplay.h & i2cdisplay.c
		    -> test master ist twitest.c
		  - start with files for main program code:
		    rotorcontrol.c, global.h, Makefile and symlinks

2011-11-22 (thjm) - software in directory LSM303 now in 1st, acceptable state

2011-08-22 (thjm) - added directories LSM303 (magnet sensor) and
                    Docu (some documentation files)
