CHANGES file for Projekte/RotorControl/DisplayUR
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

2012/05/16 (thjm) - multiplex.c: 7-segment to port mapping documented
                  - i2cdisplay.h -> i2cdisplaydefs.h

2012/01/03 (thjm) - twitest.c:
                    - test of other command types implemented
		  - i2cdisplay.*:
		    - most of other command types implemented, too
		    -> test successful!
		    - completed protocol documentation
		    - fix of command types (duplicate!)

2011/12/28 (thjm) - multiplex.*:
                    - no more kDataMode/kDirectMode
                    - direct write to segment buffer now supported

2011/12/27 (thjm) - fixed a few (partly my own) bugs in i2cslave.c
                    -> minimal version of I2C display now working
		  - basic protocol defined, most parts unimplemented

2011/12/06 (thjm) - switched interrupt routine to read from segment buffer
                  - twitest.c: I2C master for testing the display
		    + Makefile.twitest ... (different clock frequencies)

2011/12/05 (thjm) - testing board with i2cdisplay (2.12.) --> OK
                    -> decimal points must be wired, too
		       & disconnected from static level
		  - new Makefile, now generated by mfile.tcl
		    -> '-lm' is really needed (code size!)
		  - MultiplexOn() & MultiplexOff() implemented

2011/12/02 (thjm) - i2cdisplay: first test code, just displaying something...

2011/11/29 (thjm) - main.c -> ur_main.c, Makefile modified
                  - UR's source files slightly beautified
		  - started with i2cdisplay ... not yet compiling

2011/11/22 (thjm) - modified Makefile for usbasb and '-y' option
                  - starting with (simple) code modifications...
