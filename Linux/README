README file for Projekte/RotorControl/Linux
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the README file for the Linux (host) based test software (algorithms,
verification, etc.) of the rotator controller project.

analyzedat.cc - reads a file containing logged NMEA strings ($ACRAW sentences)
           acquired by the lsm303read.c program. The data are analyzed in two
	   passes:

	   1st pass: minimum and maximum values are determined
	   2nd pass: the magnetic (3D) heading of the acquired data is
	             calculated

	   The 3D heading is calculated using the MAG and ACC sensor readings.

compass1.cc - interactive version of the above program. This programs reads
           the NMEA strings from a serial interface which has to be specified
	   at the command line.

	   Different operation modes are possible:
	   c - calibration = acquiring data for new MAG min/max values
	   m - measure
	   d - debug output

*.dat - various data files from online
