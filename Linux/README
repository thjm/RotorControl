analyzedat.cc - reads a file containing logged NMEA strings ($ACRAW sentences)
           acquired by the lsm303read.c program. The data are analyzed in two
	   passes:
	   
	   1st pass: minimum and maximum values are determined
	   2nd pass: the magnetic (3D) heading of the acquired data is 
	             calculated
	   
	   The 3D heading is calculated using the MAG and ACC sensor readings.
