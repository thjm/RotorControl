# About

RotorController is for controlling a simple antenna rotator using directionaly
signals from a 3D magnet sensor (and from a 3D accelerometer).

The software is split onto several micro controllers from Atmel's AVR family.

## Usage

First you have to install a cross-build environment for AVR micro controllers.
