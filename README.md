# About

RotorController is for controlling a simple antenna rotator using directionaly
signals from a 3D magnet sensor (and from a 3D accelerometer).

The software is split onto several micro controllers from Atmel's AVR family.

- the software for the display board (hardware design based on ATmega8 from U.Radig) 
  is located in the directory ./DisplayUR
- the software for the ATmega8 at the remote magnetic/accelerometric sensor is 
  located in the directory ./LSM303
- the software foreseen to run on the main ATmega32 is in the ./ directory

## Requirements

- you need a cross-build environment for AVR micro controllers.
- the UART library from Peter Fleury http://homepage.hispeed.ch/peterfleury/doxygen/avr-gcc-libraries/group__pfleury__uart.html
  unpacked to a local directory
- the TWI master library from Peter Fleury http://homepage.hispeed.ch/peterfleury/doxygen/avr-gcc-libraries/group__pfleury__ic2master.html
  unpacked to a local directory
- the environment variable FLEURYHOME must point to the root of both directories

## Usage

Compile the software in the 3 source directories ./LSM303, ./DIsplayUR and ./ is 
generated by typing make in ./
